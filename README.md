# ArtifactDetect

PyrAmes is developing thin, flexible sensors that can be worn on the wrist for continuous blood pressure monitoring. However, motion can introduce artifacts into the signals, making it difficult to calculate blood pressure. As a consulting project for PyrAmes, I developed an unsupervised clustering model to classify motion artifacts in their signals. The data consisted of ~2500 hours collected simultaneously from 4 blood pressure sensors and an accelerometer. Although the data cannot be shared, here is some code I used to visualize the data, quantify basic metrics like total duration of the recordings, and cluster using Gaussian mixture models.
